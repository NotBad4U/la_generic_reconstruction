\begin{abstract}
Modern SMT solvers can generate proofs of unsatisfiability to ensure correctness independently of their implementation.
A dependable approach to verify these proofs is to reconstruct them within a proof assistant.
In previous work, the SMT checker Carcara was extended to reconstruct SMT proofs in Lambdapi — a proof assistant designed for interoperability,
supporting the import and export of proofs for integration with other proof assistants such as Rocq, Lean, or HOL-Light.
Whereas that work was limited to SMT theories without arithmetic, we here present an extension that enables the reconstruction of SMT proofs involving linear integer arithmetic.

\section{Introduction}

SMT solvers have become capable of producing proofs of unsatisfiability,  enabling independent verification of correctness without relying on the solver's implementation.
This development addresses the growing need for trustworthy verification in safety-critical applications and for using SMT solvers as backends of skeptical proof assistants that do not trust the solver.
Alethe \cite{alethe,alethespec} is an established SMT proof format supported by the solvers cvc5 and veriT. In our previous work \cite{ColtellacciMD24}, we extended the Alethe proof checker and elaborator Carcara \cite{carcara} to
reconstruct Alethe SMT proofs within the Lambdapi proof assistant, thereby ensuring their validity.
Lambdapi \cite{lambdapi} is a proof assistant based on the $\lambda\Pi$-calculus modulo rewriting \cite{lpmodulo}, a logical framework \cite{lf} that extends the $\lambda$-calculus with dependent types and user-defined rewrite rules.
This foundation allows Lambdapi to serve as a framework for formalizing various logical systems.
Designed with interoperability in mind, Lambdapi can import and export proofs, facilitating integration with other proof assistants \cite{LPAR2024:Translating_HOL_Light_proofs} such as Rocq \cite{Rocq-refman}, Lean \cite{lean4:2021}, and HOL-Light. 

However, our prior work was limited to proofs expressed within the logic of Uninterpreted Functions (UF) and Quantifier-Free (QF), as well as their subtheories.\todo[sm]{What does this mean? If it's QF\_UF, it should be written like that, but then there is no sub-theory.} 
In the present work, we extend this approach to support the reconstruction of proof steps involving linear integer arithmetic (LIA).
When the propositional model is unsatisfiable\todo[sm]{Doesn't make any sense.} in the theory of linear (integer) arithmetic, the solver creates a proof certificate.
The conclusion\todo[sm]{Conclusion of what?} is a tautological clause of linear inequalities and equations and the justification of the step is a list of coefficients so that the linear combination becomes a trivially contradictory inequality after simplification (e.g., $0 \geq 1$).\todo[sm]{This covers la\_generic, but there is more to LIA.}
To verify these certificates, we implemented an automatic decision procedure based on proof by reflection \cite{reflection-origin-coq,ring-coq}.
% Most SMT solvers, including cvc5 and veriT, use the simplex method \cite{SRI:simplex:dpllt} to handle linear arithmetic.\todo[sm]{Is that relevant for proof checking?}


The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
In \cref{sec:background}, we provide an overview of Lambdapi and present the structure of Alethe proof certificates for linear arithmetic.
Then, in \cref{sec:elaboration-lia}, we describe how we leverage Carcara's elaboration process to reconstruct linear integer arithmetic steps, even when coefficient annotations are missing.
In \cref{sec:encoding} introduces our encoding of SMT linear arithmetic within Lambdapi, while in \cref{sec:lia-reconstruction} presents an automatic decision procedure, based on proof by reflection, to verify these arithmetic steps.
An empirical evaluation of our approach is provided in \cref{sec:evaluation}. We review related work in \cref{sec:related}, and we conclude in \cref{sec:conclusion}.

\section{Related work}
\label{sec:related}

The reconstruction for Alethe proofs produced by the veriT solver has been implemented within Isabelle/HOL to enhance the reconstruction success rate compared to Z3.
The authors employed Isabelle's \emph{linarith} procedure to replay arithmetic reasoning steps. This tactic serves as a decision procedure over real numbers, rather than integers or natural numbers, and is based on Fourier-Motzkin elimination.
However, the authors note that Isabelle's arithmetic procedure is incomplete and relatively inefficient for reconstructing arithmetic proofs; consequently, specific rules are reconstructed heuristically to improve performance.

Besson \cite{micromega} introduces a modular framework for integrating SMT solvers with the Rocq proof assistant, emphasizing the generation and efficient verification of proof certificates directly within Coq.
His approach enables fast, reflexive proof checking using Nelson-Oppen-style theory combination, and it supports both Linear Integer Arithmetic (LIA) and Linear Arithmetic (LA) logics.
To efficiently generate Farkas certificates for LA, the technique relies on the Simplex algorithm, while for LIA, a variant of the Omega test \cite{omegatest} is adopted.
The technique has been evaluated on SMT-LIB 2 benchmarks using the Z3 solver.

Compared to these approaches, which demonstrate stronger scalability in handling larger and more complex systems of inequalities, our method does not scale as well in certain arithmetic heavy cases.
As shown in \cref{sec:evaluation}, performance degrades on benchmarks such as \emph{rings}, where large instances of rule \tt{la\_generic} are generated.
Nevertheless, our framework offers the advantage of supporting proof export from Lambdapi to other systems. This interoperability enables the reuse of valid SMT proofs in external environments such as Rocq.


\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We presented an extension of Carcara's \cite{carcara} translation module \cite{ColtellacciMD24} for reconstructing arithmetic reasoning steps in Alethe proof traces involving the \tt{LIA} theory in the foundational proof assistant Lambdapi \cite{lambdapi}.
Our method includes a ring solver inspired by the computational reflection techniques described in \cite{reflection-origin-coq,ring-coq}.

We have shown that this allows us to reconstruct several thousand SMT proofs that originate from the SMT-lib Benchmarks.
Nonetheless, the current implementation does not scale well in arithmetic-heavy cases.
As future work, we plan to improve Lambdapi’s built-in normalization mechanism to better handle such cases.
We also intend to extend our work to support rational and real arithmetic, enabling verification of broader fragments of linear arithmetic (\texttt{LA}) theories.
