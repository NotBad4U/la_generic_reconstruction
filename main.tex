\section{Introduction}

SMT solvers have become capable of producing proofs alongside their satisfiability results,  enabling independent verification of correctness without relying on the solver's implementation.
This development addresses the growing need for trustworthy verification in safety-critical applications and SMT solver usage in proof assistant, where the solver cannot be assumed to be fully trusted.
The Alethe \cite{alethe,alethespec} is an established SMT proof format generated by the solvers cvc5 and veriT. In our previous work \cite{ColtellacciMD24}, we extended the Alethe proof checker and elaborator Carcara \cite{carcara} to
reconstruct Alethe SMT proofs within the Lambdapi proof assistant, thereby ensuring their validity.
Lambdapi is an interactive proof assistant based on the $\lambda\Pi$-calculus modulo rewriting, a logical framework that extends the $\lambda$-calculus with dependent types and user-defined rewrite rules.
This foundation allows Lambdapi to serve as a framework for formalizing various logical systems.
Designed with interoperability in mind, Lambdapi can import and export proofs, facilitating integration with other proof assistants such as Rocq, Lean, and HOL-Light. 

However, our prior work was limited to proofs expressed within the logic of Uninterpreted Functions (UF) and Quantifier-Free (QF) fragments. 
In the present work, we extend this approach to support the reconstruction of proof steps involving linear integer arithmetic (LIA).
When the propositional model is unsatisfiable in the theory of linear real/integer arithmetic, the solver creates a proof certificate.
The conclusion is a tautological clause of linear inequalities and equations and the justification of the step is a list of coefficients so that the linear combination is a trivially contradictory inequality after simplification (e.g., $0 \geq 1$).
Most SMT solvers, including cvc5 and veriT, use the simplex method \cite{SRI:simplex:dpllt} to handle linear arithmetic.
